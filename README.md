## Procedure for providing access to the SweLL corpora

* Application form: [https://sunet.artologik.net/gu/swell](https://sunet.artologik.net/gu/swell)
    * Those who are (1) geographically from Europe and (2) have research interests within language learning (research, teaching, development, assessment, etc) should be approved.
    * Those who deviate in any of the two conditions above, should be recommended to send their application to GU lawyers (e.g. Erica Schweder < erica.schweder@gu.se >)

If approved: 
* Store application file on Nextcloud (folder SweLL-v1/SweLL_user_agreements)
* Add Korp-user using [https://ws.spraakbanken.gu.se/](https://ws.spraakbanken.gu.se/) to *SweLL, SW1203, TISUS* and *SpIn* corpora
* Add user-mail to the NextCloud-folder (for corpus file download, **SweLL_release_v1**), set password and an expiration date for the access link (â‰ˆ1 month from the granting day) and mail out. Use the following text and cc to *swell@svenska.gu.se*:

    *Thank you for your interest in the SweLL data!*
    
    *You can download the data from **LINK** using password **PASSWORD***
       
    *The password is valid for 1 month, so make sure you download the data in time.*
    
    *Happy exploring,*

 * The list of applicants should be available through [https://sunet.artologik.net/gu/swell](https://sunet.artologik.net/gu/swell) (application form), but we would need to evaluate the procedure and see whether there is a need to keep track of all approved users.
