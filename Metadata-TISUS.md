### 1.1 Description of the project

TISUS is a subcorpus of SweLL-pilot collection of learner essays written by adult immigrants learning Swedish in Sweden. The essays were collected from an official exam **T**est **I**n **S**wedish for **U**niversity **S**tudies, TISUS, during one occasion in 2006. The setting of the essay collection has given the name to this subcorpus. Learners filled in consent forms and allowed use of their essays and personal metadata for research. 

Essays were collected and transcribed on the initiative of individual exam assessors at Stockholm University, Sweden. All later work on linguistic annotation, file format conversions and CEEFR mappings was funded by *Språkbanken* and *Center for Language Technology* (CLT), both at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, during 2012-2016. Part of the work on metadata harmonization was carried out later as part of the [*L2 profiles project*](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en/projects/l2profiles) and [*SweLL infrastructure project*](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/en/projects/swell). 

For approved users, TISUS is available through Korp search interface and as a full dataset via a link that is sent to approved users. To get access, apply using this form: [https://sunet.artologik.net/gu/swell](https://sunet.artologik.net/gu/swell). 

The TISUS subcorpus is maintained at the University of Gothenburg, Språkbanken Text ([https://spraakbanken.gu.se](https://spraakbanken.gu.se)), as part of the SweLL infrastructure.

### 1.2 Description of the TISUS subcorpus 

(*Version from 2016*) Elena Volodina, Ildikó Pilán, Ingegerd Enström, Lorena Llozhi, Peter Lundkvist, Gunlög Sundberg, Monica Sandell. 2016. SweLL on the rise: Swedish Learner Language corpus for European Reference Level studies. Proceedings of LREC 2016, Slovenia. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06583.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06583.pdf)

(*Version from 2021*) The above article + updated statistics in this documentation. The major difference between the versions from 2016 and 2021 is that all attributes and the corresponding values (e.g. level, language names, etc) have been harmonized between several other learner subcorpora in the SweLL collection to make possible searches in several of them at the same time.

*Personal data management*: Essays were collected following a consent from the learners. The consent allows the use of essays for research by registered (approved) users. Handwritten essays were transcribed and manually anonymized by trained L2 specialists.

*Mode/format*: All essays were written in exam setting. Most of the essays were written by hand and were transcribed later by L2 specialists. 

*Time constraints* ??? hours;
No *access to extra materials* was allowed except handouts. However, no handouts are made available to corpus users (see details in *Task Metadata*).

*CEFR levels* are indicative only. They were assigned by mapping grades on the written assignment according to the following scheme: failed (i.e. grades 1-2) => B2, grades 3-5 => C1. This mapping was made based on the assumption that since the test was announced as equivalent to CEFR level C1, all "passed" students on the written assignment had competence of that level or higher. A more rigorous re-grading is planned for future.
